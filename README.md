# Eve Profile Synchronizer
A tool for the game  [EVE-Online](https://eveonline.com) to make your life with character profiles a lot easier.

## Description
In your EVE client, you can change and adjust things like window positions, chats, themes, overview settings, etc. You need to adjust this for every character. If you change some settings and want this change on all characters, you must adapt it manually for every other character again.

This is where the "EVE Profile Synchronizer" can significantly help you. This tool takes a chosen account's character profile and copies it to all other selected characters. Voila! All characters have the same settings as the preselected character. And you can do it as often as you need it.

Features of the EVE Profiles Synchronizer:

- Synchronize profile data to other characters
- Shows alliance and corp with every character
- Shows the character's avatar
- Everything is set automatically
- Backups are made before every sync
